### Animation Shorthand in CSS
The animation shorthand property allows you to define multiple animation properties in a single line. It combines the following properties:

1. animation-name
2. animation-duration
3. animation-timing-function
4. animation-delay
5. animation-iteration-count
6. animation-direction
7. animation-fill-mode
8. animation-play-state


```css
  animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode play-state;
```

Default Values
If any component is omitted, its default value is used:

1. animation-name: none
2. animation-duration: 0s
3. animation-timing-function: ease
4. animation-delay: 0s
5. animation-iteration-count: 1
6. animation-direction: normal
7. animation-fill-mode: none
8. animation-play-state: running
